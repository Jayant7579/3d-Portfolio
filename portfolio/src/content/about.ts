export const about = `I'm a Computer Science graduate who enjoys building software that is thoughtful, reliable, and impactful. My interest in technology started with web development, where I learned how good design and clean code come together to create meaningful user experiences. Over time, this curiosity expanded into backend systems and artificial intelligence, where I became fascinated by how data and logic power real-world applications. I have hands-on experience working with frontend technologies like React, backend development using APIs and databases, and building AI-driven solutions using Python and machine learning concepts. I enjoy understanding how systems work end to end - from user interfaces to data flow, business logic, and intelligent decision-making. What excites me most is the process of learning by building, experimenting, and continuously improving.

I approach problems with a balance of creativity and structure. I value clean architecture, attention to detail, and writing code that is easy to understand and maintain. I'm comfortable collaborating with teams, learning from feedback, and adapting quickly in fast-paced environments.

As an early-career engineer, I'm focused on growing my skills while contributing to projects that have real impact. I'm especially motivated by roles where I can combine software engineering with modern technologies like AI to build solutions that truly matter.`
